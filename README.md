# Social Network API

## Description
Using MongooseDB, I was able to create the backend for a social network api. With this API, anyone can create a user, check for existing users, update user information, or delete them. Once a user has been registered they can befriend other users and share their thoughts and reactions with each other in an relatively easy manner.

## Installation

In order to run the API, you would need to run 'npm install' as well as 'npm install express' and 'npm install' Mongoose.

## Usage

Below, you'll find that I separated the mechanics of this API into separate videos for each attribute:
